    <h2>Why I am taking CS50 Course</h2>
    <p> I am taking this course because of my interest in Computer Science. My University is teaching very slowly.<br>
        Apart from Slow teaching, they don't teach very deeply like in CS50. Currently I'm in Second Semester, They only
        taught me
        basic HTML tags and very basic CSS properties which were useless. Here In this course, I have been given
        resources and lectures to get in-depth knowledge, Which I always crave.</p>

    <h5 align="center">Thank You Harvard University for arranging this free course for us! <3</h5>
